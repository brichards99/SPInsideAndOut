## Kanban and Project Management for this Course

*What should you know before diving into this topic?*

You should be generally familiar with software development concepts, and having experience with working on a development team will be helpful. This subject is really geared toward a specific way of working, so if you are no coder, these concepts may seem very abstract.

*Why do we need to get into this?*

Even though learning the details of technical development in ServiceNow do not require project management, it certainly helps with planning projects and being able to carry your skills forward into the workplace. 

## Why this?

The primary goal of our work together is to build up your skills as a Service Portal developer, but for the projects here just like projects you will tackle on the job the central pillar of success is communication. And the key to good communication for projects is your project management approach.

For this reason we will model a common approach to ServiceNow project management so that not only will you have clear direction regarding what I intend for you to do, but the way you will get those directions here will be famliiar later on.

### Agile Development

Every ServiceNow team I have worked on has used the Agile Development approach to project management, although to be fair none of them have really implemented all of the components one might learn in a classroom regarding how Agile should work. We will not go all the way either, but at the very least we should be clear on what should be happening.

Agile Development methodology is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and customer satisfaction. It involves breaking a large software development project into smaller, more manageable pieces or "sprints," and developing and testing each piece separately. The process is highly flexible and can adapt to changes in requirements, design, and testing as the project progresses.

Agile development is based on [the Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), a set of principles for software development that prioritize individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and response to change. Some of the concepts associated with Agile include:

* Scrum: A framework for managing and completing complex projects that involves regular meetings, daily standups, and the use of sprint backlogs and burn-down charts.
* Kanban: A lean method for managing and improving work processes that involves visualizing work, limiting work-in-progress, and measuring lead time and cycle time.
* Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): Practices that involve integrating code changes frequently, testing them automatically, and deploying them to production quickly and reliably.
* Pair Programming: A practice in which two programmers work together on a single workstation, collaborating on design, coding, testing, and documentation.
* Test-Driven Development (TDD): A practice in which developers write automated tests before writing any code, and then use the tests to guide their development process.

Let's dig into the big ones a bit further:

## Scrum

Scrum is an Agile framework for managing and completing complex software development projects and is supposed to be a lightweight, iterative approach that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and rapid delivery of working software. It is based on the principles of the Agile Manifesto and was first introduced in the early 1990s.

The core of Scrum is the Scrum Team, which consists of a Product Owner, a Scrum Master, and a Development Team. The Product Owner is responsible for defining the product backlog, which is a prioritized list of features and requirements for the software being developed. The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring that the Scrum process is followed and for removing any roadblocks or external hinderances that may be blocking the team. The Development Team, naturally enough, is responsible for designing, developing, and testing the software.

Scrum projects are divided into short iterations called Sprints, typically 1-4 weeks in length. At the beginning of each Sprint, the Scrum Team conducts a Sprint Planning meeting, during which the team selects a set of items from the product backlog to work on during the Sprint. The team then works on these items, holding daily stand-up meetings to review progress, identify any impediments, and plan the work for the next day. At the end of each Sprint, the team conducts a Sprint Review meeting, during which they demonstrate the working software they have completed and gather feedback from stakeholders. The team also holds a Sprint Retrospective meeting, during which they reflect on the Sprint and identify areas for improvement.

For our work together -- especially since my expectation is that you will be completing this as a team of one --  the whole scrum appraoch does not makes sense. I think it is important to know what it is, but let's set that idea aside for now.

## User Stories

In the context of Scrum, a user story is a brief, informal description of a feature or requirement from the perspective of the end user or customer. User stories are a key component of Agile development and are used to capture and prioritize requirements in a way that is easy to understand and communicate.

A user story typically consists of three ingredients: a brief description of the desired feature or functionality, the user or customer who needs the feature, and the goal or outcome that the user or customer hopes to achieve by using the feature. For example, a user story for a website might read:

"As a registered user, I want to be able to save items to my wishlist in the heade of the portal so that I can keep track of products I am interested in purchasing."

User stories are written from the perspective of the user or customer and are intentionally informal and flexible, to encourage collaboration and discussion between the development team and the stakeholders. They are typically written on index cards or sticky notes and are organized into a product backlog, which is a prioritized list of features or requirements that the development team works on during each Sprint.

User stories provide a way to ensure that development efforts are focused on delivering value to the end user or customer, and they enable the team to break down complex requirements into smaller, more manageable pieces. By using user stories, Scrum teams can prioritize requirements based on the value they provide to the user, and can deliver working software in a way that is responsive to changing needs and requirements.

## Kanban

Here is my alternative to Scrum. Do this if the spirit of how you (or your team) get things done is 'a continuous stream of improvements.' If you think about it this is pretty much what we are doing with this course, so it makes sense to think of what we are doing in terms of Kanban project management.

Kanban is a workflow management method (and therefore not necessarily project management) that has the lofty goal of helping organizations manage and improve work systems. It is a simplified way of handling work that helps you manage the flow of tasks as your team works toward shared objectives, and in my opinion has the terrific advantage of being rather visual.  

The term Kanban originates from Toyota’s “just-in-time” production system, which means doing “only what is needed, when it is needed, and in the amount needed.” The purpose of Kanban is to eliminate wasteful work, inconsistencies, and unreasonable requirements. By applying the Kanban approach to project management, the workflow becomes fully transparent and visual. Each team member can see who works on a particular task, what is being worked on, and so on. As a result, you can focus on the right tasks, and you won’t exceed the capacity of any individual on the team.

Conceptually a key difference between Agile and Kanban is the approach each takes to work in progress. Agile limits how much effort is currently in progress by dividing tasks into sprints, whereas Kanban limits work in progress at each stage of the workflow. In Agile, teams complete a set of tasks within a specific time frame, whereas in Kanban, teams focus on completing tasks as soon as possible, allowing tasks to move quickly between stages. 

A Kanban board is a physical or digital project management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency or flow. In a Kanban board, tasks are represented as cards that move through stages of work represented as columns. The most basic Kanban board might have columns like “To do,” “In progress,” and “Done.” Each column is filled with visual cards that represent individual tasks. A team moves through the columns until the tasks are completed.

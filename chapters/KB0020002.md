## Service Portal and the Employee Center

Before we proceed with how we work with Service Portal things let’s review some important first principles of this tool. To begin with , ServiceNow is a database driven workflow platform. The primary purpose that drives how it works it the notion of gathering information about work that needs to be done into a record, and then pushing that record through a workflow of updates, notifications, and programmatic changes to other records.

Now think about how things get done in a workplace — whether it’s an IT help desk or a Human Resources office or a computer store. There are customers and salespeople, HR reps and employees, people who lost their passwords and people who can reset passwords. These are each complex relationships, and the various roles of the people involved imply things like the ability to help, the authority to view data, and responsibility for taking actions on things.

If those work-related records are all stored in one big database drive platform, not everyone should see things in those records in the same way. Since things change from office to office and company to company, it’s kind of unfair to think that the talented and clever people at ServiceNow should create a single interface to get at those records that works for everyone. That’s why from early on in the platform’s history ServiceNow has provided an ‘employee experience’ interface that is more easily customized and is a little more user friendly so that we can differentiate between what is basically the fulfiller’s view and the customer’s view. Back end and front end.

Early on that employee experience view was the CMS, or Content Management System. Some companies may actually still have this in use, although I hope not. After CMS ServiceNow developed a more standards-based and more easily deployed interface called the Service Portal and this is of course why we are working together.

ServiceNow is an incredibly complicated workflow platform, and with regards to the topic of this course that implies two important things: there are a large number of features of the product that relevant only to people who are fulfilling
